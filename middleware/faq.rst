Why do queries return duplicate results?
========================================

.. py:currentmodule:: lsst.daf.butler

The `Registry.queryDataIds`, `~Registry.queryDatasets`, and `~Registry.queryDimensionRecords` methods can sometimes return true duplicate values, simply because the SQL queries used to implement them do.
You can always remove those duplicates by wrapping the calls in ``set()``; the `DataCoordinate`, `DatasetRef`, and `DimensionRecord` objects in the returned iterables are all hashable.
This is a conscious design choice; these methods return lazy iterables in order to handle large results efficiently, and that rules out removing duplicates inside the methods themselves.
We similarly don't want to *always* remove duplicates in SQL via ``SELECT DISTINCT``, because that can be much less efficient than deduplication in Python, but in the future we may have a way to turn this on explicitly (and may even make it the default).
We do already remove these duplicates automatically in the :program:`butler` command-line interface.

It is also possible for `~Registry.queryDatasets` (and the :program:`butler query-datasets` command) to return datasets that have the same dataset type and data ID from different collections,
This can happen even if the users passes only collection to search, if that collection is a `~CollectionType.CHAINED` collection (because this evaluates to searching one or more child collections).
These results are not true duplicates, and will not be removed by wrapping the results in ``set()``.
They are best removed by passing ``findFirst=True`` (or ``--find-first``), which will return - for each data ID and dataset type - the dataset from the first collection with a match.
For example, from the command-line, this command returns one ``calexp`` from each of the given collections:

..
    Can't use prompt:: directive here instead because it can't handle program output.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ butler query-datasets /repo/main calexp \
        --collections HSC/runs/RC2/w_2021_06/DM-28654 \
        --collections HSC/runs/RC2/w_2021_02/DM-28282 \
        --where "instrument='HSC' AND visit=1228 AND detector=40"

     type                  run                    id   band instrument detector physical_filter visit_system visit
    ------ ----------------------------------- ------- ---- ---------- -------- --------------- ------------ -----
    calexp HSC/runs/RC2/w_2021_02/DM-28282/sfm 5928697    i        HSC       40           HSC-I            0  1228
    calexp HSC/runs/RC2/w_2021_06/DM-28654/sfm 5329565    i        HSC       40           HSC-I            0  1228

(with no guaranteed order!) while adding ``--find-first`` yields only the ``calexp`` found in the first collection:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ butler query-datasets /repo/main calexp --find-first \
        --collections HSC/runs/RC2/w_2021_06/DM-28654 \
        --collections HSC/runs/RC2/w_2021_02/DM-28282 \
        --where "instrument='HSC' AND visit=1228 AND detector=40"

    type                  run                    id   band instrument detector physical_filter visit_system visit
    ------ ----------------------------------- ------- ---- ---------- -------- --------------- ------------ -----
    calexp HSC/runs/RC2/w_2021_06/DM-28654/sfm 5329565    i        HSC       40           HSC-I            0  1228

Passing ``findFirst=True``/``--find-first`` requires the list of collections to be clearly ordered, however, ruling out wildcards like ``...`` ("all collections"), globs, and regular expressions.
Single-dataset search methods like `Butler.get` and `Registry.findDataset` always use the find-first logic (and hence require ordered collections).

Why are some keys (usually filters) sometimes missing from data IDs?
====================================================================

While most butler methods accept regular dictionaries as data IDs, internally we standardize them into instances of the `DataCoordinate` class, and that's also what will be returned by `Butler` and `Registry` methods.
Printing a `DataCoordinate` can sometimes yield results with a confusing ``...`` in it::

    >>> dataId = butler.registry.expandDataId(instrument="HSC", exposure=903334)
    >>> print(dataId)
    {instrument: 'HSC', exposure: 903334, ...}

And similarly asking for its ``keys`` doesn't show everything you'd expect (same for ``values`` or ``items``); in particular, there are no ``physical_filter`` or ``band`` keys here, either::

    >>> print(dataId.keys())
    {instrument, exposure}

The quick solution to these problems is to use `DataCoordinate.full`, which is another more straightforward `~collections.abc.Mapping` that contains all of those keys:

    >>> print(dataId.full)
    {band: 'r', instrument: 'HSC', physical_filter: 'HSC-R', exposure: 903334}

You can also still use expressions like ``dataId["band"]``, even though those keys *seem* to be missing:

    >>> print(dataId["band"])
    r

The catch is these solutions only work if `DataCoordinate.hasFull` returns `True`; when it doesn't, accessing `DataCoordinate.full` will raise `AttributeError`, essentially saying that the `DataCoordinate` doesn't know what the filter values are, even though it knows other values (i.e. the ``exposure`` ID) that could be used to fetch them.
The terminology we use for this is that ``{instrument, exposure}`` are the *required* dimensions for this data ID and ``{physical_filter, band}`` are *implied* dimensions::

    >>> dataId.graph.required
    {instrument, exposure}
    >>> dataId.graph.implied
    {band, physical_filter}

The good news is that any `DataCoordinate` returned by the `Registry` query methods will always have `~DataCoordinate.hasFull` return `True`, and you can use `Registry.expandDataId` to transform any other `DataCoordinate` or `dict` data ID into one that contains everything the database knows about those values.

The obvious follow-up question is why `DataCoordinate.keys` and stringification don't just report all of they key-value pairs the object actually knows, instead of hiding them.
The answer is that `DataCoordinate` is trying to satisfy a conflicting set of demands on it:

- We want it to be a `collections.abc.Mapping`, so it behaves much like the `dict` objects often used informally for data IDs.
- We want a `DataCoordinate` that *only* knows the value for required dimensions to compare as equal to any data ID with the same values for those dimensions, regardless of whether those other data IDs also have values for implied dimensions.
- `collections.abc.Mapping` defines equality to be equivalent to equality over ``items()``, so if one mapping includes more keys than the other, they can't be equal.

Our solution was to make it so `DataCoordinate` is always a `~collections.abc.Mapping` over just its required keys, with ``full`` available sometimes as a `~collections.abc.Mapping` over all of them.
And because the `~Mapping` interface doesn't prohibit us from allowing ``__getitem__`` to succeed even when the given value isn't in ``keys``, we support that for implied dimensions as well.
It's possible it would have been better to just not make it a `~collections.abc.Mapping` at all (i.e. remove ``keys``, ``values``, and ``items`` in favor of other ways to access those things).
`DataCoordinate` :ref:`has already been through a number of revisions<lsst.daf.butler-dev_data_coordinate>`, though, and it's not clear it's worth yet another try.
